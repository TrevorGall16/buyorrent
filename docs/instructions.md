# MASTER INSTRUCTION: RENT-OR-BUY PRO

**To:** Builder AI
**Role:** Senior Full-Stack Engineer
**Context:** You are building a high-performance programmatic SEO website.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT
You have been provided with 3 specific specification files:
1. `01_LOGIC_AND_FLOW.md` (The Business Logic)
2. `02_UI_UX_SPECS.md` (The Visuals)
3. `03_TECH_STACK.md` (The Architecture & Performance)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT IGNORE)
1. **Cross-Reference:** Do not implement UI components (File 02) without checking the Technical Constraints (File 03).
2. **Ad Safety:** You must strictly follow the "CLS Protection" rules in File 02. If the UI shifts layout, the project fails.
3. **SEO First:** The architecture in File 03 is non-negotiable. It is designed for maximum indexing.

## EXECUTION ORDER
1. **Initialize:** Set up the stack defined in File 03.
2. **Logic:** Write the math library defined in File 01.
3. **Components:** Build the UI components defined in File 02 (adhering to File 03 structure).
4. **Pages:** Assemble the pages using the Programmatic approach in File 03.

**START:** Acknowledge you have read all files and list the stack you are about to use.
